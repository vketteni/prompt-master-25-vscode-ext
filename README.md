# prompt-master-25 README

## Overview

**prompt-master-25** is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides a fast and reliable way to **copy function signatures and bodies** in customizable formats. This extension makes it easy to extract function details, including class methods, and efficiently retrieve them for quick reference.

## Features

- **Function Extraction**: Automatically detects all functions and methods in a file.
- **Quick Pick Menu**: Easily search and copy function details.
- **Class-Aware Method Listing**: Methods now display their **ClassName.methodName** format for better identification.
- **Customizable Copy Format**: Configure function copy settings via VS Code settings.
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Works with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more.

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code** v1.60.0+
- A supported **language server** (e.g., Pylance for Python, TypeScript for JS/TS)

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `prompt-master-25.format`: Defines the format for copied functions. Options:
  - `signature`: Copy only the function signature.
  - `body`: Copy only the function body.
  - `full`: Copy the entire function.
- `prompt-master-25.customTemplate`: Allows defining a custom format using `{name}`, `{params}`, and `{body}` placeholders.

## Usage

1. Open a file containing functions or class methods.
2. Use the command **`prompt-master-25.copyFunction`** to open the quick function list (`Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Copy Function").
3. Select a function to copy it to the clipboard.
4. Paste the function anywhere you need it.

## Known Issues

- Class methods may not be detected if the language server does not provide nested symbols.
- May not work with all VS Code-supported languages; tested primarily with Python and JavaScript.
